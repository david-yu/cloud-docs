= Role-Based Access Control
:description: Role-based access control (RBAC) lets you manage and restrict access to specific clusters and resource groups.
:page-categories: Management, Security
:page-beta: true

Use role-based access control (RBAC) in Redpanda Cloud to manage and restrict access to specific clusters and resource groups. With RBAC, you can assign roles to users when you add them, and you can assign roles to a service account when you create it. These roles determine the permissions that users and service accounts have when interacting with Redpanda Cloud. For example, you can limit users to only being able to view clusters managed by their team, or you can restrict users from changing clusters in the production environment. 

Users with multiple roles receive the union of all permissions defined in those roles. When you change the permissions for a given role, all users and service accounts with that role automatically gain the modified permissions. You can assign any number of roles to a given user. When installing a new Redpanda cluster, no roles are provisioned by default.

Read role

* See which permissions/ACLs are associated with it 
* See which users are utilizing this role, so that she can be sure which people/machines the role affects, particularly when changes are made

Update role 

* Change the ACLs associated with this role 
* Change the users associated with this role 

Delete role 

* When a role is deleted, it is removed from the user it is attached to and permissions revoked.

Create role

* Clicks to create
* Can name the role + any other parameters  
* Can create ACLs for the role, save it 
* Can optionally apply the role to existing users 
* Can optionally create a new user to apply the role to 

Creating a user

* Alice clicks to create
* Can name the user, define a password and its mechanism 
* Can create ACLs 
* Optionally can create a role from the ACLs and name the role. 

You can assign a combination of ACLs and roles to any given principal. ACLs allow permissions, deny permissions, or specify a combination of both. As a result, users may at times have role assignments with conflicting policies. If this situation arises, the user is permitted to perform an operation if:

* There does not exist a DENY permission matching the operation.
* There exists an ALLOW permission matching the operation.

You can manage your RBAC configurations with the https://cloud.redpanda.com[Redpanda Cloud UI^], the xref:api:ROOT:cloud-api.adoc[Cloud API], or xref:reference:rpk/rpk-security/rpk-security.adoc[`rpk security`]. 

== Roles

Roles are configurable sets of ACLs. Redpanda Cloud provides the following predefined roles: <<viewer,viewer>>, <<editor,editor>>, and <<admin,admin>>.

=== Viewer

The viewer role grants permissions to view all resources. This includes:

* View all topic aspects (messages, configs, partitions, using search filters)
* View all cluster aspects (node configs, ACLs, service accounts, quotas)
* View all consumer group aspects (consumer groups, group offsets and lags)
* View all schema registry aspects (registered schemas with their contents)
* View all Kafka Connect aspects (list configured clusters and their connectors, including the status and connector configs)
* It does not include permissions to view the list of users.

=== Editor

The editor role grants all permissions that come with the viewer role and additionally includes:

* Manage all topic aspects, such as creating topics, editing topic configurations, deleting topics, and publishing and deleting topic records.
* Manage all cluster configuration aspects, such as editing node or cluster configs.
* Manage all consumer group aspects, such as editing group offsets or deleting group offsets.
* Manage all Kafka connect aspects, such as creating/updating/deleting or starting/pausing/stopping connectors.
* It does not include the permission to create/remove ACLs or to create or remove a service account.

=== Admin

The admin role grants all permissions that come with the editor role and additionally includes:

* Manage all service account aspects (create/remove service accounts)
* Manage all ACL aspects (create/remove ACLs)

== Role bindings

To grant users the permissions defined in a role, you bind (assign) the role to a user or a group. You can assign multiple roles to users through role bindings. When a user is associated with more than one role, the user is granted all the permissions defined in each role they are assigned. For example, if a user is assigned both the viewer and editor roles, they have all the permissions of a viewer as well as the additional permissions of an editor.

Duplicate role bindings do not cause errors or conflicts. If a user is assigned the same role multiple times through role bindings, the duplicate role bindings do not affect the user's final set of permissions, which are the same as if the role was assigned once.

The *Security - Roles* page lists all roles and the principals assigned to the role. 

== Manage access for organization

In the Redpanda Cloud UI, go to the *Organization IAM* page to see a list of your organization's existing users and service accounts and their associated roles. You can edit a user's org-level access, invite new users, or create service accounts. Service accounts are assigned admin permissions to all resources in the organization. 

Link to Control Plane API? 

== Manage access for cluster or resource group

On the *Security - Access Control* page, you can see, edit, and delete existing users, roles, and ACLs. You can also add users, roles, and ACLs. A user may have the viewer role assigned for one cluster and the editor role assigned for another cluster. 

The xref:manage:api/cloud-dataplane-api.adoc[Data Plane APIs] enable you to programmatically manage the resources within your clusters, roles, users, and access control lists (ACLs).

== Manage access

=== Create a role

Creating a new role is a two-step process. First you define the role, giving it a unique and descriptive name. Second, you assign one or more ACLs to allow or deny access for the new role. This defines the permissions that are inherited by all users assigned to the role. It is possible to have an empty role with no ACLs assigned.

--
Administrators use `rpk` to create a new role by issuing the command:

[,bash]
----
rpk security role create <role_name>
----

After the role is created, administrators create new ACLs and assign this role either allow or deny permissions. For example:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create ... --allow-role <role_name>
----

Example of creating a new role named `red`:
[,bash]
----
rpk security role create red
----

[,bash,role=no-copy]
----
Successfully created role "red"
----

Administrators use Redpanda Console to create a new role by following these steps:

1. Select `Security` from the left navigation menu.

2. Select the `Roles` tab.

3. Click *Create Role*.

4. In the `Create Role` view, provide a name for the role and an optional origin host for users to connect from.

5. Define the permissions (ACLs) for the role. You may create ACLs for topics, consumer groups, and transactional IDs.

6. __(Optional)__ You may assign one or more principals (users) to the role as part of creating it.

7. Click *Create*.

=== Delete a role

When a role is deleted, Redpanda carries out the following actions automatically:

- All role ACLs are deleted.
- All users' assignments to the role are removed.

Redpanda lists all impacted ACLs and role assignments when executing this command. You will receive a prompt to confirm the deletion action. The delete operation is irreversible.

=== Edit role permissions

Administrators may add or remove ACLs from any of the roles they have previously created.

[tabs]
====
rpk::
+
--
Using `rpk`, administrators can modify an existing role by adding additional ACLs to it using the command:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create ... --allow-role <role_name>
----

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create ... --deny-role <role_name>
----

Administrators may also use `rpk` to remove ACLs from a role by using the command:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl delete ... --allow-role <role_name>
rpk security acl delete ... --deny-role <role_name>
----

When you execute the `rpk security acl delete` command, Redpanda deletes all ACLs matching the parameters supplied. Make sure to match the exact ACL you want to delete. If you supply only the `--allow-role` parameter, for example, Redpanda will delete every ACL granting that role authorization to a resource.

To list all the ACLs associated with a role, administrators may use the command:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl list --allow-role <role_name> --deny-role <role_name>
----

== RBAC example

Consider a scenario where your software engineers use a set of private topics to publish application update information to users. All your private topics begin with the prefix `private-`. You might create a new `SoftwareEng` role to represent the software engineers with write access to these private topics. You would then assign the `SoftwareEng` role as the allowed role for a new ACL specifying read and write permissions to `private-*`. Using a wildcard includes all existing private topics and any new ones you might create later. You then assign the new role to John and Jane, your two software engineers who will write messages to this topic. The `rpk` commands to accomplish this are:

[,bash]
----
rpk security role create SoftwareEng &
rpk security acl create --operation read --operation write --topic private-* --allow-role SoftwareEng &
rpk security role assign SoftwareEng --principal User:john,User:jane
----

This diagram shows the relationships between users, roles, and ACLs:

image::shared:rbac-roles.png[RBAC role assignments]

Building off the diagram, consider the situation where you want to create a new topic, `private-software-versions`, where users self-report the version of a component they are using. If you were using the ACL authorization mechanism, you would need to assign this ACL to every user in your Redpanda installation. Using RBAC allows you to make one update and apply it to everyone with that role. Adding the write permissions for this topic to the `User` role means everyone with that role (which in our diagram is all authenticated users) gains the authorization immediately. The `rpk` command to accomplish this is:

[,bash]
----
rpk security acl create --operation write --topic private-software-versions --allow-role User
----
